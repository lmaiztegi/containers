.. _UserGuide:GUI:

Tools with GUI
##############

By default, tools with Graphical User Interface (GUI) cannot be used in containers, because there is no graphical
server.
However, there are multiple alternatives for making an `X11 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System>`__ or
`Wayland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)>`__ server visible to the container.
`gh:mviereck/x11docker <https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker>`__ and `gh:mviereck/runx <https://github.com/mviereck/runx>`__
are full-featured helper scripts for setting up the environment and running GUI applications and desktop environments in
OCI containers.
GNU/Linux and Windows hosts are supported, and security related options are provided (such as cookie authentication).
Users of GTKWave, KLayout, nextpnr and other tools will likely want to try x11docker (and runx).
