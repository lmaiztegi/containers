Tasks
#####

* Add the missing ASIC tools to collection ``debian/bullseye``.
  All together in OpenROAD (:ghsharp:`46`).
  Following the order in `efabless/openlane: OpenLANE Design Stages <https://github.com/efabless/openlane#openlane-design-stages>`__
  is suggested.

* Add the missing tools to collection ``centos/7``.
  This collection is currently empty (it contains the base dockerfile only).
  It was added because OpenLane containers are based on ``centos:7``, but may be updated to ``centos:8``.
  Moreover, some DARPA users might be constrained to ``centos:6``.
  We should confirm that.

* Setup cross-triggering between CI workflows.
  Currently, all workflows are triggered at the same time.
  That produces some races and some tools are built twice in the same run (`moby/buildkit#1930 <https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1930>`__).
  That is not critical because we do know how to solve it (:ghsrc:`github/trigger.sh <github/trigger.sh>`).
  We didn't implement it yet because we'd like it to be automatically sychronised with the graphs (see :ref:`Development:graphs`).

* Coordinate with Antmicro/SymbiFlow for using self-hosted runners provided by Google and their orchestration plumbing.

* Enhance the (atomic) `smoke-tests <https://github.com/hdl/smoke-tests>`__, which are currently placeholders mostly.

* Provide multiarch manifests.
  See `dbhi/qus <https://github.com/dbhi/qus>`__ and `Multi-arch build and images, the simple way
  <https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/>`__.

* Versioning.
  Currently, images are not versioned explicitly.
  Images are only pushed when builds and tests are successful.
  Users which cannot afford breaking changes can use the image by digest, instead of doing it by name.
  However, we should probably leverage manifests for publishing some *versioned ecosystems*, implying that we run a full
  test suite on an specific group of images and we then tag them all together as a *nicely behaving family/release*.

.. NOTE::
   These are all in no particular order, although most of them are closely related to each other.
   It you want to tackle any of them, `let us know <https://github.com/hdl/containers/issues/new>`__ or `join the chat <https://gitter.im/hdl/community>`__!


.. _Development:credentials:

Credentials
===========

In order to push images to container registries, credentials are required.
The default ``github.token`` is enough for publishint to GHCR, however, docker.io and GCR do need specific secrets to be
setup.

In The Google Cloud Platform (GCP), credentials are managed through a CLI tool named ``gcloud``.
Periodically, a new key needs to be created and the outdated ones need to be removed.

.. code-block:: shell

   # List the available service accounts:
   ~ gcloud iam service-accounts list

   # Note the e-mail of the service account, and list the keys:
   ~ gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account=[NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com

   # Create a new key and save it to a file:
   ~ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create keyfile.json --iam-account [NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com

   # Go to organisation secrets and update the GCR_JSON_KEY secret with the whole content of the JSON file
   # https://github.com/organizations/hdl/settings/secrets/actions

   # Remove the JSON file
   ~ rm keyfile.json

   # Remove other (expired) keys
   ~ gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete KEY_ID --iam-account [NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com

See `cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json-key <https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json-key>`__.
